### Case Report Forms (CRFs)
Two INFORM CRFs are needed to categorize a child’s HIV status, the INFORM Child Baseline CRF and the INFORM Maternal Baseline CRF.  The data needed to establish a child’s status as either HIV-exposed uninfected, HIV-unexposed uninfected or HIV-infected, along with a level of certainty of that level, relies on criteria established by the DECIPHER (**D**ata **E**valuation and **CI**PHER **P**reparation for an **H**IV **E**xposed Uninfected Child Coho**r**t) project funded by the Collaborative Initiative Pediatric HIV Education and Research (CIPHER). Baseline CRFs that must be completed are as follows: 
- Infant Baseline Data
-	Maternal Baseline Data

### Electronic CRFs
For the INFORM baseline CRFs we have elected to use REDCap as our platform for electronic data capture. In the repository link below, you will find downloadable REDCap instruments.

### Paper based CRFs
While the INFORM instruments are ideally suited for electronic data capture, we recognize that all sites may not have this capability. For this reason, all electronic CRFs are also available in a paper-based format in the repository below:

### Data Quality Monitoring Tools
Recognizing that data collection is a human effort and therefore prone to error, we are utilizing REDCap’s Data Quality Rules to ensure complete and logical data acquisition. By downloading and executing this REDCap module at appropriately scheduled intervals, missing and nonsensical data can be quickly identified and appropriately managed.

### Data analysis tools
To achieve data analysis uniformity, INFORM data analysis has been programmed in SAS and STATA. To create baseline maternal and infant characteristics tables by child HIV exposure status, use the links below to download the code.  You must have SAS or STATA applications on your computer in order to make use of this code.
