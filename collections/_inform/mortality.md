### Case Report Forms (CRFs)
Where studies are interested in assessing differences or similarities in all-cause mortality between children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected compared with children who are HIV-unexposed and uninfected, there are two INFORM All-Cause Mortality tools.  The first tool should be used for child death events where the death occurred outside a health facility.  For this, the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) Verbal Autopsy is being used.  It is available open source Android application (ODK) or via a paper format. It can be analyzed using open source software recommended by the WHO called InterVA.  For death events which occur within a health facility, the REDCap-based INFORM All Cause Mortality CRF should be used.  Because the 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy collects household sociodemographic data and care seeking behavior that may not be available from abstraction of medical records following a death event occurring in the hospital, studies may elect to supplement the REDCap-based INFORM All-Cause Mortality CRF with an interview of the caregiver using the 2016 WHO verbal autopsy, as suggested by the dotted in the figure below.

### Electronic CRFs
The INFORM All-Cause Mortality CRF for death events occurring in the hospital is REDCap-based and the REDCap instrument can be accessed using the repository link below. For death events occurring outside the hospital the 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy Android application should be used and can be accessed using the link below.  The 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy can also supplement data abstracted from medical records, in the event that a caregiver is available to be interviewed after a child dies in a health facility.

### Paper based CRFs
While the INFORM instruments are ideally suited for electronic data capture, we recognize that all sites may not have this capability. For this reason, the INFORM All-Cause Mortality CRF for deaths occurring in a health facility and the components of the 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy   are also available in a paper-based format in the repository below:

### Data Quality Monitoring Tools
Recognizing that data collection is a human effort and therefore prone to error, we are utilizing REDCapâ€™s Data Quality Rules to ensure complete and logical data acquisition. By downloading and executing this REDCap module at appropriately scheduled intervals, missing and nonsensical data can be quickly identified and appropriately managed.

### Data analysis tools
To assess all-cause child mortality differences between children who are HEU and those HUU ages 1 month to 59 months, the INFORM project has developed uniform approaches to statistical analysis for death events occurring within the hospital. These data analysis packages are available in SAS and STATA and be accessed at the following repositories:

InterVA, the WHO recommended software for analyze datasets generated through the use of the 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy instrument, can be accessed in the following repository: *Repository for InterVA Data Analysis Tool:* [Link](link-target)
