### Case Report Forms (CRFs)
The INFORM Infectious Morbidity CRFs have been designed to characterize the type of infectious event(s) for which a child was hospitalized, attribute the degree of certainty for each diagnosis, and collect data in order to assign illness severity. These data instruments are designed to evaluate infectious morbidity and severity among children ranging in age from 29 days (post-neonatal) to 59 months. Using a child’s hospital chart and ancillary hospital information such as laboratory investigations and diagnostics studies, data collected on the INFORM Infectious Morbidity Case Report Forms (CRFs) can be analyzed to assess for differences in frequency and severity of infectious disease events requiring hospitalizations between children HIV-exposed uninfected and those who are HIV-unexposed uninfected. A third comparator group of children with HIV can be included based on the research question of interest. The six INFORM Infectious Morbidity CRFs that must be completed are as follows: 
- Hospitalization - General Information
- Hospitalization – History
- Hospitalization – Physical Exam Findings
- Hospitalization – Diagnostic Tests
- Hospitalization – Diagnoses and Treatments
- Hospitalization – Disease Severity

### Electronic CRFs
For the INFORM Infectious Morbidity CRFs we have elected to use REDCap as our platform for electronic data capture. In the repository linked below, you will find downloadable REDCap instruments.

### Paper based CRFs
While the INFORM instruments are ideally suited for electronic data capture, we recognize that all sites may not have this capability. For this reason, all electronic CRFs are also available in a paper-based format in the repository below:

### Data Quality Monitoring Tools
Recognizing that data collection is a human effort and therefore prone to error, we are utilizing REDCap’s Data Quality Rules to ensure complete and logical data acquisition. By downloading and executing this REDCap module at appropriately scheduled intervals, missing and nonsensical data can be quickly identified and appropriately managed.

### Data analysis tools
To assess infectious morbidity differences between children who are HEU and those HUU, the INFORM project has developed uniform approaches to statistical analysis. These data analysis packages are available in SAS and STATA.
