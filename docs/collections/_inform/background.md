Over 1 million infants who are exposed to HIV during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding annually remain HIV uninfected, with 80% also exposed to maternal antiretrovirals (ARVs). Although they are HIV-free, these children are not achieving comparable health, growth and survival outcomes to infants born to women without HIV. Establishing harmonized exposure and outcome definitions, with uniform methodological approaches to studying outcomes of children who are HIV exposed uninfected (CHEU), with/without ARV exposure, has potential for more rapid identification of modifiable drivers of disparities.

The INFORM project convened a Scientific Expert Panel (SEP) to identify priority outcomes among CHEU, amenable to data harmonization through standardized definitions and measurements. Technical Working Groups (TWGs) reviewed scientific literature, identifying standardized approaches to defining child health outcomes and existing tools applicable or adaptable to measuring disparities between CHEU and children HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU).  

The INFORM SEP identified infectious morbidity and all-cause mortality as the first two priority outcomes and established two TWGs. The Infectious Morbidity TWG identified respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, meningitis, measles, malaria, and “other” as leading causes of infectious morbidity among CHEU, and created case report forms (CRF) for use in children age <5 years hospitalized for infectious events. For each type of infectious illness, two levels of diagnostic certainty and three level of disease severity were established based upon published literature. The All-Cause Mortality TWG selected the 2016 World Health Organization’s Verbal Autopsy survey for assessing cause of death among children age <5 years when death events occur outside a health facility and created a CRF for death events occurring within a health facility. INFORM data instruments  are designed for online or paper-based use by researchers or health systems and harmonization provides the opportunity for pooling of data across studies.

The INFORM project provides a mechanism for monitoring safety of newer ARV regimens used in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Additionally, it is designed to identify modifiable biological, sociodemographic, and/or structural (e.g. health policies, ethnic/racial disparities) drivers of health disparities between CHEU and CHUU. Ultimately, INFORM results can guide the development of interventions to improve the health and survival of CHEU.
